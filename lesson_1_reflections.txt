How did viewing a diff between the two versions of the file help you to see the bug that was introduced?


How could having easy access to the entire history of files help you to be a better programmer?


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros
- Makes more sense.
- Uses judgment.

Cons
- May lose work?

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like google Docs, treat each file separately.

google docs are meant for things like word processing docs, and Git is meant for large things like codebases.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Knowing that you can revert back to an older version gives you the confidence to make mistakes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what are you trying to use git for?
